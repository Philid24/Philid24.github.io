Here is a beginners guide to bird terminology, classifications and slang used by bird watchers. 

Passerine birds = having feet that are adapted to perching, includes all songbirds.

Bins = Binoculars 

Pied = Having fur or feathers of two or more colours, usually black and white

Bop = Bird of prey

Patch = an area frequently visited by birdwatchers

For a comprehensive collection of bird terminology check out Bird Academy by Cornell Lab, see link. [Bird Academy Glossary](https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/bird-academys-a-to-z-glossary-of-bird-terms/). I will add definitions and descriptions as they come up in my exploration. For the more casual terms thrown around by "birdies" here was an amusing Glossay of [Bird Watching Slang](https://birding-world.com/glossary-birdwatching-slang/).
