    "text": "Overview\nWagtails are passerine birds and belong to the genus “Motacilla” (a latin name introduced by Swedish Naturalist Carl Von Linnaeus in 1758). The Motacillas are part of the family Motacillidae, which include Wagtails, Pipits and Longclaws. Within the Motacilla genus (Wagtails) there are 13 different species which are found all over the world. Now it starts to get confusing, (at least for me) because there are other types of wagtails that do not belong to the same genus. For example, the Willie Wagtail from Australia does not have the same genus, it belongs to group called Fantails."

This species is prevalent throughout the country.The young African Pied Wagtails sport a brownish plumage, which transforms as they mature. Adult birds are easily recognizable by their distinct black and white coloration, they also have a prominent white eyebrow stripeThese adaptable birds thrive in a variety of environments: Urban and suburban areas, including residential lawns (as observed in our own backyards where ever we have lived). Otherwise they are known to be spotted in the wild by streams or other natural water sources. A fun fact i just learnt, they have been known to nest in unusual spots like in cars and abandoned machinery."

Widespread Presence The Spotted Eagle-Owl is commonly seen south of the equator across the African continent.

The only environment they avoid is the desert.\n\nThriving in Urban Areas Their adaptability extends to suburban living, where parks and gardens provide safe spaces for roosting and nesting. Spotted Eagle-Owls are known to return to their nesting spots year after year if they remain undisturbed, making them a common sight in more urbanized areas.\nThe Smallest of Eagle-Owls Among all eagle-owls, the Spotted Eagle-Owl is the smallest. With a height of up to 45cm, a weight of approximately 700g, and a wingspan of about 1 meter, they may be small, but they are easily recognizable by their ear tufts and large, bright yellow eyes.\nA Voracious Appetite These owls are opportunistic eaters with diets dictated by their environment. Their prey ranges from insects and frogs to lizards, small mammals, and birds. Thanks to their excellent vision, they can locate prey from high perches like tree branches or street poles before swooping in for the kill.\nSwallowing Prey Whole Spotted Eagle-Owls swallow their prey whole—bones, fur, and all. If the prey is too large, they tear it into smaller pieces. After 6 to 12 hours, they regurgitate a pellet of bones and other indigestible parts, leaving evidence of their recent meal.\nA True Night Owl Being nocturnal, the Spotted Eagle-Owl emerges at dusk to hunt, as many of their prey are most active during this time. It’s not uncommon to spot them perched on streetlights, using the height advantage to scan the area for food.\nSuperior Vision and Hearing With exceptional vision and acute hearing, these owls are well-equipped for nighttime hunting. They cannot move their eyeballs, so they must rotate their heads to look in different directions. Although far-sighted, they have excellent low-light vision, and their hearing is so sharp that they can locate prey by sound alone, even if it’s hidden from sight.\nCamouflage Their brown, patterned feathers provide effective camouflage, helping them blend seamlessly into their surroundings. The soft texture of their feathers allows for silent flight, making them stealthy hunters. During the day, they sit motionless, blending into their surroundings with eyes closed, ensuring they remain undisturbed.\nDistinct Vocalizations Male and female Spotted Eagle-Owls often engage in duets, with the female’s voice slightly higher-pitched than the male’s. Their communication consists of two or three-note hoots, while a single hoot is used as an alarm call.\nLifelong Mates These owls form monogamous pairs, staying together for life. During the nesting period, the male hunts for food while the female incubates the eggs.

    "text": "Photo by New York Times\n\n\nThe African House Gecko, also known as the Tropical House Gecko, is a fascinating reptile species that has become a common sight in our household. Belonging to the family Gekkonidae and genus Hemidactylus, this small lizard has adapted remarkably well to human habitations across tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, despite its origins in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThese geckos are easily recognizable by their mottled grey or brown coloration, which provides excellent camouflage against walls and ceilings. They typically measure between 10-15 cm in length, including their tail. One of their most striking features is their large, lidless eyes, perfectly adapted for their nocturnal lifestyle. This adaptation is evident in our home, where we’ve observed increased gecko activity during evening hours, particularly around dusk. The African House Gecko possesses remarkable climbing abilities, thanks to the adhesive lamellae on its toes. This feature allows them to scale smooth surfaces with ease, explaining their frequent presence on both exterior and interior walls of our house. We’ve noticed they have a particular affinity for areas near windows and outdoor lights, likely due to the abundance of insects in these locations.\nSpeaking of insects, these geckos play a crucial role in natural pest control. They are insectivorous carnivores with a diverse diet including mosquitoes, flies, moths, beetles, spiders, and cockroaches. In our household, we’ve noticed a significant reduction in flying insect populations, which we attribute to the presence of these efficient hunters. It’s particularly entertaining to watch them near our outdoor lighting fixtures, where they’ve learned to wait patiently for insects attracted to the light.\nDespite their small size, African House Geckos are surprisingly vocal. They are capable of producing a range of sounds, from quiet chirps to louder squeaks. On quiet nights, especially near open windows, we’ve been treated to the gentle vocalizations of these tiny reptiles, adding an interesting auditory element to their presence. In terms of behavior, these geckos are primarily solitary and territorial, especially the males. They are most active during the night, spending daylight hours hidden in crevices and dark spaces around the house. This nocturnal nature, combined with their hunting habits, makes evenings the best time for gecko-watching in our home.\nFrom a conservation standpoint, the African House Gecko is categorized as “Least Concern” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This classification is due to their wide distribution, adaptability to human environments, and the absence of any significant threats to their population. Their successful colonization of our living space is a testament to their adaptability."

Interestingly, their closest relatives are the common raven and Somali crow, rather than other crow species. Omnivorous, they consume insects, small reptiles, rodents, eggs, grains, nuts, young birds, and scavenge carrion. They’ve been observed following fires to find food. Typically seen in pairs or small groups, these crows demonstrate remarkable problem-solving skills, using tools like rocks and branches to access food.

Although it will readily bite, it is completely harmless. It comes in a variety of colors: black, brown, olive green, “washed out” red, or beige. The best way to identify it is by the stripe above its eye extending to the back of the head. It is an adaptable snake often spotted in urban areas, where it feeds on rodents and lizards. Being nocturnal, it is also adept at climbing and has been observed scaling walls. We spotted one close to our home in Nairobi and were informed by the guards that it was a black mamba.

Like their other reptile relatives, snakes cannot warm themselves; they are ectothermic (I’ll add a definition at the bottom).\nThey are skilled hunters, being nocturnal and only coming out at night. The largest house snakes can eat a full-sized rat. They catch and constrict the rodents with their sharp teeth and suffocate the prey before consuming them.\nOwls are one of their predators, hunting them when they come out at night. The house snake is known to fake its own death in order to escape.\nThe Brown House snake looks very similar to the Egyptian Cobra.\nThey are known to be good pets, especially for first-time snake owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEctophermic ectotherm, any so-called cold-blooded animal—that is, any animal whose regulation of body temperature depends on external sources, such as sunlight or a heated rock surface.

Like their other reptile relatives, snakes cannot warm themselves; they are ectothermic (I’ll add a definition at the bottom).\nThey are skilled hunters, being nocturnal and only coming out at night. The largest house snakes can eat a full-sized rat. They catch and constrict the rodents with their sharp teeth and suffocate the prey before consuming them.\nOwls are one of their predators, hunting them when they come out at night. The house snake is known to fake its own death in order to escape.\nThe Brown House snake looks very similar to the Egyptian Cobra.\nThey are known to be good pets, especially for first-time snake owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEctophermic ectotherm, any so-called cold-blooded animal—that is, any animal whose regulation of body temperature depends on external sources, such as sunlight or a heated rock surface.

After careful observation and research, we’ve finally pinpointed our frequent visitor: the Black Kite (Milvus migrans). This discovery has sparked a deeper interest in understanding not just this species, but how to differentiate between various raptors. In this post, we’ll explore the Black Kite in detail and then delve into the key characteristics that set apart different raptor species."
