## Welcome to my blog about Wagtails.

This is the first post about wagtails. Wagtails are strongly patterned birds of beaches, meadows, and streamsides; they usually nest on the ground but roost in trees. The birds are so named because they incessantly wag their long tails up and down(Britannica). The question is why do they wag their tales? And how is it they seem as home in the suburban lawns of Kenya (the African Pied wagtail) as they do in similar settings in Sweden (white wagtail).
