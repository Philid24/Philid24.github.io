    "text": "I find Wagtails mysterious. Perhaps because I know so little about them despite having seen them for as long as I can remember. Every country I have lived in, cold or warm, where there is a backyard with a mowed lawn, the ever-present Wagtail has been there. Always wagging its tail alongside its group (or family?) of about 5 or 6, hunting for insects at dusk. The cats I have known over the years have never been able to catch one. My dogs have mostly ignored them. And my children scare them off, but only temporarily. Just the other day I watched a Wagtail chase a butterfly that looked almost its own size. Are they very brave, fierce hunters? Or are these just my unknowledgeable observations? You see, I am not well acquainted with Wagtails or birds for that matter. But I really like them. And the purpose of this blog is to dive deep into a bird that I do not find as exciting and mysterious as an owl or as beautiful as a Lilac-breasted Roller, but it captivates me because it is always around wherever I go and now I wish to understand it better."
