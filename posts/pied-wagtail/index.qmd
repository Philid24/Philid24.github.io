## African Pied Wagtail

As we are living in Kenya, focus will be on the only black and white wagtail found in Africa: the African Pied Wagtail (Motacilla aguimp). This species is prevalent throughout the country.
Appearance and Identification
Young African Pied Wagtails sport a brownish plumage, which transforms as they mature. Adult birds are easily recognizable by their:

Distinct black and white coloration
Prominent white eyebrow stripe

Habitat and Social Behavior
These adaptable birds thrive in a variety of environments:

Urban and suburban areas, including residential lawns (as observed in our own backyard)
Natural habitats, particularly near water sources

African Pied Wagtails are social creatures, often seen,moving in pairs and family groups

Hunting and Feeding Habits

Foraging technique:

Run along the ground in search of insects
Perform exaggerated tail-wagging motions (the purpose of which remains unclear still to me?)


Opportunistic feeding strategy:

Catch flying insects mid-air
Pick insects off the ground
Consume already dead insects when available


Hunting agility:

Capable of impressive leaps to catch airborne prey, such as butterflies.

I would like to learn more about whether they engage in group hunting behaviors? since they are always in a family or group. The African Pied Wagtail's ability to adapt its feeding habits to various food sources and environments showcases its resilience as a species.
