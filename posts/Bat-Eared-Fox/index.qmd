## Overview

The Bat-Eared Fox gets its name from its characteristic bat-like ears. These nocturnal creatures weigh between 3 to 5 kg and live for 6 to 14 years. Native to East and Southern Africa, their main predators are humans, eagles, and jackals. What makes them unique, besides their big ears, is that they have more teeth than most mammalsâ€”somewhere between 45-50. Their teeth are also notably pointed, distinguishing them from other fox species.

## Termites are their main food source

Bat-Eared Foxes primarily feed on insects, but also consume eggs and lizards. However, 80% of their diet consists of termites. The African Wildlife Foundation reports that these foxes play an important role in controlling the termite population, with a single fox capable of consuming 1.15 million termites each year! The Foundation further notes that they obtain most of their water from the body fluids of the insects they eat.

## Equal parenting 
They are monogamous creatures that live in mating pairs with their young, typically producing around three puppies a year. The males participate in guarding, playing with, and grooming the young almost as much as the females do.

## Why the big ears? 
As one would imagine, Bat-Eared Foxes have excellent hearing! Their large ears allow them to detect predators from afar. Combined with their impressive running skills, this keen sense of hearing makes them adept at evading threats.

They are also incredibly cute.....

Their main threat is shrinking of habitat on account of human development, which in turn leads to them being hunted to keep them off the agricultural land. The Bat Eared Foxes are also hunted for their fur in Botswana as well as trophy hunted in East and Southern Africa (Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana).
