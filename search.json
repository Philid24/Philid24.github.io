    "text": "I find Wagtails mysterious. Perhaps because I know so little about them despite having seen them for as long as I can remember. Every country I have lived in, cold or warm, where there is a backyard with a mowed lawn, the ever-present Wagtail has been there. Always wagging its tail alongside its group (or family?) of about 5 or 6, hunting for insects at dusk. The cats I have known over the years have never been able to catch one. My dogs have mostly ignored them. And my children scare them off, but only temporarily. Just the other day I watched a Wagtail chase a butterfly that looked almost its own size. Are they very brave, fierce hunters? Or are these just my unknowledgeable observations? You see, I am not well acquainted with Wagtails or birds for that matter. But I really like them. And the purpose of this blog is to dive deep into a bird that I do not find as exciting and mysterious as an owl or as beautiful as a Lilac-breasted Roller, but it captivates me because it is always around wherever I go and now I wish to understand it better."

    "text": "Before i begin introducing the definition and description of Wagtails i realize i personally need a beginners guide on ornithology, bird terminology and classification. Genus = Class or group Passerine birds = having feet that are adapted to perching, includes all songbirds (would have never guessed…)\nSo, Wagtails are passerine birds. They belong to the genus “Motacilla” (a latin name introduced by Swedish Naturalist Carl Von Linnaeus in 1758). The Motacillas are part of the family Motacillidae, which include Wagtails, Pipits and Longclaws. Within the Motacilla genus (Wagtails) there are 13 different species which are found all over the world. Now it starts to get confusing, (at least for me) because there are other types of wagtails that do not belong to the same genus. For example, the Willie Wagtail from Australia does not have the same genus, it belongs to group called Fantails. Furthermore, why make classifying birds as easy as differentiating them by their appearance? It is not the Wagtails different colours that helps you tell them apart (some are yellow, others grey, some distinctly black and white) because these changes are not part of their evolutionary lineages. As noted in Wikipedia these changes can occur independently.\nSee link to birdsoftheworld.org for images of Wagtails and other Motacillidaes.\nSide note Cornell Lab has an excellent (free) app for learning about and identifying the birds you see."
