##Overview

The Bat Eared Fox gets its name from its characteristic bat looking ears. They are nocturnal creatures that weight between 3 to 5 kg and live between 6 to 14 years.They are native to east and southern Africa. There main predators are humans, eagles and jackals. They have very pointy teeth and stand out from other types of foxes and most mammals because they have What makes them unique besides their big ears is that they have more teeth then most mammals, somewhere between 45-50. 

##Termites are their main food source

The Bat Eared Foxes feed primarily feeds on insects but also eggs andlizards, but 80% of their diet is termites. The African Wildlife Foundation reports that these foxes play an important role in controlling the termite population and that a single fox can consume 1.15 million termites each year! The Foundation reports further that they obtain most of their water from the body fluid of the insects. 

##Equal parenting 
They are monogonous creates that live in mating pairs plus their young, producing around three puppies a year. The males participate in guarding playing and grooming the young almost as much as the females. 

##Why the big ears? 
They have really good hearing, as one would imagine! They can hear their predators from far and are very skilled at dogding any threats as they are also very good runners. 

They are also incredibly cute..... 

Their main threat is the shrinking of their habitats on account of human development which in turn leads to them being hunted to keep off agricultural land. They are also hunted for their fur in Botswana as well as trophy hunted in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana to name a few.
