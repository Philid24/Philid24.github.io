## Spotted Eagle Owl

The Spotted Eagle Owl is a common sight across the African continent, especially south of the equator. These adaptable owls thrive in diverse habitats, from forests to grasslands, and are known to nest in treetops, shrubs, cliff ledges, and even tree hollows. Interestingly, the only environment they tend to avoid is the desert. They are also found in suburban gardens. Spotted Eagle Owls often return to the same nesting location each year, provided they remain undisturbed, making them a familiar presence in suburban settings.

Despite being the smallest of the eagle-owl species, standing up to 45 cm tall and with a wingspan of about 1 meter, they are easily recognizable by their ear tufts and striking yellow eyes. Their diet is as varied as their environment, including insects, frogs, lizards, small mammals, and birds. Perched on tree branches or street poles, they use their excellent vision to hunt before swooping in for their prey.

Remarkably, these owls swallow their prey whole, including bones and fur. When the prey is too large, they tear it into smaller pieces. After 6 to 12 hours, they regurgitate a pellet containing the indigestible parts of their meal.

Being nocturnal hunters, Spotted Eagle Owls become active at dusk, often seen perched on streetlights, scanning the area for food. Their superior vision and acute hearing make them formidable night hunters, capable of locating prey even when hidden from sight. Interestingly, they cannot move their eyeballs, so they rotate their heads to scan their surroundings.

Communication between Spotted Eagle Owls is distinct, with males and females engaging in duets. The female’s voice is slightly higher-pitched than the male’s, and their call is typically a two- or three-note hoot, while a single hoot serves as an alarm call.

These owls are monogamous, forming lifelong pairs. During nesting, the male hunts while the female incubates the eggs, which usually number between two and four, with an incubation period of 32 to 34 days.

## Owlets sleeping

The image above features a sleeping owlet. I recently learned that young owls often sleep on their stomachs due to the weight of their heads, which they are not yet strong enough to support.


### Owlet for sale

The young Spotted Eagle Owl pictured above was offered to me for sale when we first moved to Kenya. Though my initial instinct was to help, I realized it would encourage further wildlife sales. I later learned that owls often leave their nests before they can fly. The Kenya Bird of Prey Trust advises placing young owls back in a tree or shaded area, rather than attempting a rescue. 

Here is a great website for exploring all 18 owls found in Kenya and other prey birds. <https://kenyabirdofpreytrust.org>
