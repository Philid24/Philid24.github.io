## Crows

Crows are captivating creatures, renowned for their intelligence, adaptability, and boldness. This entry will begin by exploring the African Pied Crow, inspired by a recent sighting of their "meeting" on the beach, which my children attempted to disrupt. Undeterred, the birds simply relocated a short distance away.

## African Pied Crow  

The African Pied Crow, *Corvus albus* inhabits Sub-Saharan Africa, thriving in diverse environments from shorelines to mountains, riverbanks to grasslands. Their name "Pied" refers to their distinctive black and white plumage. Listed as "Least Concern" on the IUCN Red List, they're not endangered. Interestingly, their closest relatives are the common raven and Somali crow, rather than other crow species. Omnivorous, they consume insects, small reptiles, rodents, eggs, grains, nuts, young birds, and scavenge carrion. They've been observed following fires to find food. Typically seen in pairs or small groups, these crows demonstrate remarkable problem-solving skills, using tools like rocks and branches to access food. Some have even been known to place nuts on crossroads for vehicles to crack open.

## Corvids family 

Crows,ravens,jays and magpies are part of the same crow family known as the corvids. You can tell the raven apart from most crows because of it is much larger in size and has a deep gravely call and thick beak. 

I found an excellent post about [Cros and Ravens blog](https://urbannature.blog/2023/10/28/telling-crows-and-ravens-apart//).One intersting mention is that if you look up and see two smaller black birds (crows) harassing a big black bird (raven) it is very likely crows telling of a raven for getting in their territory. 

A notable example of corvid intelligence is a crow caught on video sliding down a roof on a plastic lid, purely for entertainment â€“ a testament to their cognitive abilities and playful nature.

Crow intelligence is well-documented, showcasing their remarkable problem-solving skills. Scientific studies have revealed their exceptional long-term memory, with crows capable of recognizing and remembering human faces for years. This cognitive prowess is complemented by their emotional intelligence. In captivity, crows often form strong bonds with their keepers, demonstrating their capacity for social connections. These traits collectively highlight the sophisticated nature of corvid cognition, positioning crows among the most intelligent bird species and challenging our understanding of animal intelligence.
