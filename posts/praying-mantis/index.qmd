## The Praying Mantis

# Overview 
Praying mantises are beautiful insects.There are approximately 2,400 species spread across the globe,found on every continent except Antarctica. Praying mantises are masters of camouflage. Many species have evolved to mimic leaves, twigs, and bark with such precision that they become nearly invisible in their natural surroundings. This remarkable adaptation not only helps them avoid predators but also allows them to ambush unsuspecting prey.
The name "praying mantis" comes from the distinctive posture of their forelegs, which are held folded in front of their body, resembling a position of prayer. However, this stance is less about devotion and more about readiness to strike at potential meals.
One of the most impressive features of praying mantises is their highly mobile head, which inspired this post when i watched one following me with its head as i moved around the table looking at it!  These insects can rotate their heads up to 180 degrees, providing them with an exceptionally wide field of vision. Combined with their large compound eyes, this ability makes them formidable predators. Observers often note how a mantis can follow their movements with eerie accuracy, no matter the direction of approach.

As skilled hunters, praying mantises primarily employ an ambush strategy, waiting motionlessly for prey to come within striking distance. Their diet consists mainly of other insects, including flies, crickets, and moths. 

# Cannibals?

While praying mantises are famous for sexual cannibalism - where the female eats the male after mating - this behavior is not as common as popular culture suggests. Studies have shown that it occurs in less than 30% of sexual encounters in the wild and is more prevalent in certain species and under specific conditions.

Most praying mantises are diurnal, meaning they are active during the day. However, some male mantises have adapted to nocturnal activity, likely as a strategy to avoid predators such as birds.They possess a single ear located on their thorax, primarily used to detect the ultrasonic calls of bats, their main nocturnal predators.Some species can change color to blend with their surroundings, similar to chameleons.

# 180 degree vision and stereoscopic vision! 
Praying mantises are the only insects known to have stereoscopic vision, allowing them to perceive depth and judge distances accurately.Despite their predatory nature, some cultures consider mantises beneficial insects for pest control in gardens and agriculture.

# Human and Praying Mantis bond?

 Here is a video i found of a man and his "pet" Praying Mantis that is quite sweet!
