    "text": "African Pied Crow\nThe African Pied Crow, Corvus albus inhabits Sub-Saharan Africa, thriving in diverse environments from shorelines to mountains, riverbanks to grasslands. Their name “Pied” refers to their distinctive black and white plumage. Listed as “Least Concern” on the IUCN Red List, they’re not endangered. Interestingly, their closest relatives are the common raven and Somali crow, rather than other crow species. Omnivorous, they consume insects, small reptiles, rodents, eggs, grains, nuts, young birds, and scavenge carrion. They’ve been observed following fires to find food. Typically seen in pairs or small groups, these crows demonstrate remarkable problem-solving skills, using tools like rocks and branches to access food. Some have even been known to place nuts on crossroads for vehicles to crack open."

Scientific studies have revealed their exceptional long-term memory, with crows capable of recognizing and remembering human faces for years. This cognitive prowess is complemented by their emotional intelligence. In captivity, crows often form strong bonds with their keepers, demonstrating their capacity for social connections. These traits collectively highlight the sophisticated nature of corvid cognition, positioning crows among the most intelligent bird species and challenging our understanding of animal intelligence.\n\n\n\nMet a friendly crow on the way to Ester Park in Colorado\n\n\nCrows,ravens,jays and magpies are part of the same crow family known as the corvids.

Although it will readily bite, it is completely harmless. It comes in a variety of colors: black, brown, olive green, “washed out” red, or beige. The best way to identify it is by the stripe above its eye extending to the back of the head. It is an adaptable snake often spotted in urban areas, where it feeds on rodents and lizards. Being nocturnal, it is also adept at climbing and has been observed scaling walls. We spotted one close to our home in Nairobi and were informed by the guards that it was a black mamba. However, after visiting the Watamu Snake Farm on the coast of Kenya (a wonderful place with people who genuinely care about the creatures they’re looking after), I quickly learned that black mambas are very rare in Nairobi.
