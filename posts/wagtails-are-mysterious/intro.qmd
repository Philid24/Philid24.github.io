## Discovering Wagtails 

In every country I have lived in, cold or warm, where there is a backyard with a mowed lawn, the ever-present Wagtail has been there living alongside us. I have spotted them in small villages, larger towns, beaches, alongside busy roads, and parking lots at small airportsâ€”they are everywhere!
When it comes to behavior, there is the constant wagging of its tail, hence its name. It seems to be a social bird, often in a group (or family?) of about 5 or 6, hunting for insects at dusk. The Wagtails give a brave impression; I have noted nothing nervous about their behavior, although they're not curious either of those observing them. The cats I have known over the years have never been able to catch one. My dogs and the Wagtails seem to mutually ignore each other. And my children scare them off, but only temporarily.
Just the other day, I watched a Wagtail chase a butterfly that looked almost its own size. Are they very brave, fierce hunters? Or are these just my unknowledgeable observations?
You see, I am not well acquainted with Wagtails or birds for that matter. But I really like them. And the purpose of this blog is to dive deep into a bird that I do not find as exciting and mysterious as an owl or as beautiful as a Lilac-breasted Roller, but it captivates me because it is always around wherever I go, and now I wish to understand it better.
