## Welcome to my blog about wag tails. 

This is the first post about wagtails. Wagtails are strongly patterned birds of beaches, meadows, and streamsides; they usually nest on the ground but roost in trees. The birds are so named because they incessantly wag their long tails up and down. (Britannica)
