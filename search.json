    "text": "Crow photo by Kevin Mueller on Unsplash\n\n\nCrows are captivating creatures, renowned for their intelligence, adaptability, and boldness. This entry explores the African Pied Crow, inspired by a recent sighting of their “meeting” on the beach, which my children attempted to disrupt. Undeterred, the birds simply relocated a short distance away. The African Pied Crow, Corvus albus inhabits Sub-Saharan Africa, thriving in diverse environments from shorelines to mountains, riverbanks to grasslands. Their name “Pied” refers to their distinctive black and white plumage. Listed as “Least Concern” on the IUCN Red List, they’re not endangered. Interestingly, their closest relatives are the common raven and Somali crow, rather than other crow species. Omnivorous, they consume insects, small reptiles, rodents, eggs, grains, nuts, young birds, and scavenge carrion. They’ve been observed following fires to find food. Typically seen in pairs or small groups, these crows demonstrate remarkable problem-solving skills, using tools like rocks and branches to access food. Some have even been known to place nuts on crossroads for vehicles to crack open. While not about African Pied Crows, a notable example of corvid intelligence is a crow caught on video sliding down a roof on a plastic lid, purely for entertainment – a testament to their cognitive abilities and playful nature.\n\n{{&lt; Crow  &gt;}}\nCrow intelligence is well-documented across numerous YouTube videos, showcasing their remarkable problem-solving skills. Scientific studies have revealed their exceptional long-term memory, with crows capable of recognizing and remembering human faces for years. This cognitive prowess is complemented by their emotional intelligence. In captivity, crows often form strong bonds with their keepers, demonstrating their capacity for social connections. These traits collectively highlight the sophisticated nature of corvid cognition, positioning crows among the most intelligent bird species and challenging our understanding of animal intelligence."

They are passerine birds and belong to the genus “Motacilla” (a latin name introduced by Swedish Naturalist Carl Von Linnaeus in 1758). The Motacillas are part of the family Motacillidae, which include Wagtails, Pipits and Longclaws. Within the Motacilla genus (Wagtails) there are 13 different species which are found all over the world.

For example, the Willie Wagtail from Australia does not have the same genus, it belongs to group called Fantails.\nThe African Pied Wagtail (Motacilla Aguimp) is the only black and white wagtail found in Africa.
