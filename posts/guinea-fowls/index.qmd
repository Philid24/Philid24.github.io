While stopping for a night in Mombasa, we spotted a white guinea fowl in the hotel gardens, which was a first for me! This breed is called the White African Guinea Fowl, a variant of the more common Helmeted Guinea Fowl (Numida meleagris). These beautiful birds are known for their distinctive appearance and interesting behaviors:

Appearance: Unlike their wild counterparts, which have dark feathers with white spots, White African Guinea Fowl have pure white plumage. They retain the characteristic bare head and neck of the species.
Habitat: Guinea fowl are native to Africa and prefer open grasslands, savannas, and lightly wooded areas. They have adapted well to human-altered landscapes, including farms and gardens.
Behavior: These birds are highly social and typically live in flocks. They are known for their loud, chattering vocalizations, which they use for communication within the group.
Free-ranging nature: Guinea fowl are indeed known for their love of free-ranging. While they can be kept in enclosures, they thrive when allowed to roam freely. This behavior is beneficial for pest control, as they eat insects and small rodents.
