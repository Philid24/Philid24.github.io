    "text": "Overview\nWagtails are passerine birds and belong to the genus “Motacilla” (a latin name introduced by Swedish Naturalist Carl Von Linnaeus in 1758). The Motacillas are part of the family Motacillidae, which include Wagtails, Pipits and Longclaws. Within the Motacilla genus (Wagtails) there are 13 different species which are found all over the world. Now it starts to get confusing, (at least for me) because there are other types of wagtails that do not belong to the same genus. For example, the Willie Wagtail from Australia does not have the same genus, it belongs to group called Fantails."

This species is prevalent throughout the country.The young African Pied Wagtails sport a brownish plumage, which transforms as they mature. Adult birds are easily recognizable by their distinct black and white coloration, they also have a prominent white eyebrow stripeThese adaptable birds thrive in a variety of environments: Urban and suburban areas, including residential lawns (as observed in our own backyards where ever we have lived). Otherwise they are known to be spotted in the wild by streams or other natural water sources. A fun fact i just learnt, they have been known to nest in unusual spots like in cars and abandoned machinery."

    "text": "Overview\nThe Bat-Eared Fox gets its name from its characteristic bat-like ears. These nocturnal creatures weigh between 3 to 5 kg and live for 6 to 14 years. Native to East and Southern Africa, their main predators are humans, eagles, and jackals. What makes them unique, besides their big ears, is that they have more teeth than most mammals—somewhere between 45-50. Their teeth are also notably pointed, distinguishing them from other fox species."

The African Wildlife Foundation reports that these foxes play an important role in controlling the termite population, with a single fox capable of consuming 1.15 million termites each year! The Foundation further notes that they obtain most of their water from the body fluids of the insects they eat."

Combined with their impressive running skills, this keen sense of hearing makes them adept at evading threats.\nThey are also incredibly cute…..\n Their main threat is shrinking of habitat on account of human development, which in turn leads to them being hunted to keep them off the agricultural land. The Bat Eared Foxes are also hunted for their fur in Botswana as well as trophy hunted in East and Southern Africa (Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana)."

Their name “Pied” refers to their distinctive black and white plumage. Listed as “Least Concern” on the IUCN Red List, they’re not endangered. Interestingly, their closest relatives are the common raven and Somali crow, rather than other crow species. Omnivorous, they consume insects, small reptiles, rodents, eggs, grains, nuts, young birds, and scavenge carrion. They’ve been observed following fires to find food. Typically seen in pairs or small groups, these crows demonstrate remarkable problem-solving skills, using tools like rocks and branches to access food. Some have even been known to place nuts on crossroads for vehicles to crack open."
