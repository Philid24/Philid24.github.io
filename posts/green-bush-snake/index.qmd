## Eastern Natal Green Snake (*Philothamnus natalensis*)

The Eastern Natal green snake is a beautiful non-venomous bright grass-green snake that’s often active during the day, hunting for geckos and frogs. These snakes are agile climbers and are often seen high up in trees. They’re quick to escape when disturbed, but can give a defensive bite if handled.

Because of its bright green color, this snake is often mistaken for the more dangerous Boomslang or Green Mamba, leading to unnecessary harm. The Eastern Natal Green Snake is completely harmless, though. One of its unique features is the keeled scales on its belly and the underside of its tail. It tends to be a vibrant green, with a hint of light yellow on its belly and chin, making it truly a sight to behold.

These snakes are native to areas from Amanzimtoti along the KwaZulu-Natal coast, all the way into the Kruger National Park and Mozambique.

### Spotted at our property

Sadly, the snake we spotted had been run over and, despite bringing it to a safe spot away from predators and cars, it passed away shortly after. Though its life ended tragically, it was a beautiful sight, and we felt fortunate to have witnessed this incredible creature up close.
