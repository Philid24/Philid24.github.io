    "text": "Overview\nWagtails are passerine birds and belong to the genus “Motacilla” (a latin name introduced by Swedish Naturalist Carl Von Linnaeus in 1758). The Motacillas are part of the family Motacillidae, which include Wagtails, Pipits and Longclaws. Within the Motacilla genus (Wagtails) there are 13 different species which are found all over the world. Now it starts to get confusing, (at least for me) because there are other types of wagtails that do not belong to the same genus. For example, the Willie Wagtail from Australia does not have the same genus, it belongs to group called Fantails."

This species is prevalent throughout the country.The young African Pied Wagtails sport a brownish plumage, which transforms as they mature. Adult birds are easily recognizable by their distinct black and white coloration, they also have a prominent white eyebrow stripeThese adaptable birds thrive in a variety of environments: Urban and suburban areas, including residential lawns (as observed in our own backyards where ever we have lived). Otherwise they are known to be spotted in the wild by streams or other natural water sources. A fun fact i just learnt, they have been known to nest in unusual spots like in cars and abandoned machinery."

Their name “Pied” refers to their distinctive black and white plumage. Listed as “Least Concern” on the IUCN Red List, they’re not endangered. Interestingly, their closest relatives are the common raven and Somali crow, rather than other crow species. Omnivorous, they consume insects, small reptiles, rodents, eggs, grains, nuts, young birds, and scavenge carrion. They’ve been observed following fires to find food. Typically seen in pairs or small groups, these crows demonstrate remarkable problem-solving skills, using tools like rocks and branches to access food.

This cognitive prowess is complemented by their emotional intelligence. In captivity, crows often form strong bonds with their keepers, demonstrating their capacity for social connections.

    "text": "Photo by New York Times\n\n\nThe African House Gecko, also known as the Tropical House Gecko, is a fascinating reptile species that has become a common sight in our household. Belonging to the family Gekkonidae and genus Hemidactylus, this small lizard has adapted remarkably well to human habitations across tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, despite its origins in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThese geckos are easily recognizable by their mottled grey or brown coloration, which provides excellent camouflage against walls and ceilings. They typically measure between 10-15 cm in length, including their tail. One of their most striking features is their large, lidless eyes, perfectly adapted for their nocturnal lifestyle. This adaptation is evident in our home, where we’ve observed increased gecko activity during evening hours, particularly around dusk. The African House Gecko possesses remarkable climbing abilities, thanks to the adhesive lamellae on its toes. This feature allows them to scale smooth surfaces with ease, explaining their frequent presence on both exterior and interior walls of our house. We’ve noticed they have a particular affinity for areas near windows and outdoor lights, likely due to the abundance of insects in these locations.\nSpeaking of insects, these geckos play a crucial role in natural pest control. They are insectivorous carnivores with a diverse diet including mosquitoes, flies, moths, beetles, spiders, and cockroaches. In our household, we’ve noticed a significant reduction in flying insect populations, which we attribute to the presence of these efficient hunters. It’s particularly entertaining to watch them near our outdoor lighting fixtures, where they’ve learned to wait patiently for insects attracted to the light.\nDespite their small size, African House Geckos are surprisingly vocal. They are capable of producing a range of sounds, from quiet chirps to louder squeaks. On quiet nights, especially near open windows, we’ve been treated to the gentle vocalizations of these tiny reptiles, adding an interesting auditory element to their presence. In terms of behavior, these geckos are primarily solitary and territorial, especially the males. They are most active during the night, spending daylight hours hidden in crevices and dark spaces around the house. This nocturnal nature, combined with their hunting habits, makes evenings the best time for gecko-watching in our home.\nFrom a conservation standpoint, the African House Gecko is categorized as “Least Concern” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This classification is due to their wide distribution, adaptability to human environments, and the absence of any significant threats to their population. Their successful colonization of our living space is a testament to their adaptability."

Interestingly, the only environment they tend to avoid is the desert. They are also found in suburban gardens. Spotted Eagle Owls often return to the same nesting location each year, provided they remain undisturbed, making them a familiar presence in suburban settings.\nDespite being the smallest of the eagle-owl species, standing up to 45 cm tall and with a wingspan of about 1 meter, they are easily recognizable by their ear tufts and striking yellow eyes. Their diet is as varied as their environment, including insects, frogs, lizards, small mammals, and birds. Perched on tree branches or street poles, they use their excellent vision to hunt before swooping in for their prey.\nRemarkably, these owls swallow their prey whole, including bones and fur. When the prey is too large, they tear it into smaller pieces. After 6 to 12 hours, they regurgitate a pellet containing the indigestible parts of their meal.\nBeing nocturnal hunters, Spotted Eagle Owls become active at dusk, often seen perched on streetlights, scanning the area for food. Their superior vision and acute hearing make them formidable night hunters, capable of locating prey even when hidden from sight. Interestingly, they cannot move their eyeballs, so they rotate their heads to scan their surroundings.\nCommunication between Spotted Eagle Owls is distinct, with males and females engaging in duets. The female’s voice is slightly higher-pitched than the male’s, and their call is typically a two- or three-note hoot, while a single hoot serves as an alarm call.\nThese owls are monogamous, forming lifelong pairs.

I recently learned that young owls often sleep on their stomachs due to the weight of their heads, which they are not yet strong enough to support.\n\nOwlet for sale\n\n\n\nCaptured owlet outside of Nairobi\n\n\nThe young Spotted Eagle Owl pictured above was offered to me for sale when we first moved to Kenya. Though my initial instinct was to help, I realized it would encourage further wildlife sales. I later learned that owls often leave their nests before they can fly. The Kenya Bird of Prey Trust advises placing young owls back in a tree or shaded area, rather than attempting a rescue.\nHere is a great website for exploring all 18 owls found in Kenya and other prey birds. https://kenyabirdofpreytrust.org"

After careful observation and research, we’ve finally pinpointed our frequent visitor: the Black Kite (Milvus migrans). This discovery has sparked a deeper interest in understanding not just this species, but how to differentiate between various raptors. In this post, we’ll explore the Black Kite in detail and then delve into the key characteristics that set apart different raptor species."
