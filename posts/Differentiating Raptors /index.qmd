## Kites, Eagles and Hawks- How to tell them apart.

For weeks, our backyard has been filled with the distinctive calls of what we could only identify as some type of raptor. After careful observation and research, we've finally pinpointed our frequent visitor: the Black Kite (Milvus migrans). This discovery has sparked a deeper interest in understanding not just this species, but how to differentiate between various raptors. In this post, we'll explore the Black Kite in detail and then delve into the key characteristics that set apart different raptor species.

# The Black Kite 

The Black Kite, despite its name, is primarily dark brown with a characteristic forked tail. With a wingspan reaching up to 1.5 meters, it's a medium-sized raptor known for its impressive aerial agility. Black Kites are opportunistic feeders, often seen soaring effortlessly while scanning for prey or carrion. Their diet is diverse, including small mammals, birds, insects, and even human refuse in urban areas.

One of the most distinctive features of the Black Kite is its flight pattern. They exhibit a slight dihedral wing position when gliding and are known for their ability to feed on the wing, a behavior not commonly seen in many other raptors. This adaptability has allowed them to thrive in various habitats, from open lands to urban environments.

# Moving beyond the Black Kite, let's examine how to differentiate between major raptor groups:

Eagles: Generally the largest raptors, eagles are characterized by their robust build, large heads, and powerful beaks. Their wings are broad and often held flat or slightly raised in a "V" shape during soaring. 

Hawks: Medium-sized raptors with broad, rounded wings and relatively short tails. They typically exhibit a flap-and-glide flight pattern. 

Falcons: Recognized by their pointed wings, long tails, and streamlined bodies adapted for high-speed flight. Falcons like the Peregrine (Falco peregrinus) are known for their incredible diving speeds during hunting.

Kites: Including our Black Kite, these raptors have long, often forked tails and slender wings. They're highly maneuverable in flight and often feed on insects or small prey caught in the air.

Vultures: Large scavenging raptors with broad wings designed for soaring on thermals. They have distinctive bare heads, an adaptation for hygiene when feeding on carrion. 

Owls: While not always grouped with diurnal raptors, owls are notable for their forward-facing eyes, round heads, and silent flight.
