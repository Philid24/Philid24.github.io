    "text": "As we are living in Kenya, focus will be on the only black and white wagtail found in Africa: the African Pied Wagtail (Motacilla aguimp). This species is prevalent throughout the country. The young African Pied Wagtails sport a brownish plumage, which transforms as they mature. Adult birds are easily recognizable by their distinct black and white coloration, they also have a prominent white eyebrow stripe\nHabitat and Social Behavior These adaptable birds thrive in a variety of environments: Urban and suburban areas, including residential lawns (as observed in our own backyard). Otherwise in natural habitat they are mostly spotted near water sources\nAfrican Pied Wagtails are social creatures, often seen,moving in pairs and family groups.They run along the ground in search of insects and perform exaggerated tail-wagging motions (the purpose of which remains unclear still to me?)\nOpportunistic feeding strategy:\nCatch flying insects mid-air Pick insects off the ground Consume already dead insects when available\nHunting agility:\nCapable of impressive leaps to catch airborne prey, such as butterflies (as witnessed some months ago in our backyard).\nI would like to learn more about whether they engage in group hunting behaviors? since they are always in a family or group. The African Pied Wagtail’s ability to adapt its feeding habits to various food sources and environments showcases its resilience as a species.\nHere are a collection of videos and overview information i found on the net about African Pied Wagtails see link : https://ebird.org/species/afpwag1"

    "text": "I find Wagtails to be an enigma. Perhaps because I know so little about them despite having seen them for as long as I can remember. In every country I have lived in, cold or warm, where there is a backyard with a mowed lawn, the ever-present Wagtail has been there living alongside us. I have spotted them in small villages, larger towns, beaches, alongside busy roads, and parking lots at small airports—they are everywhere! When it comes to behavior, there is the constant wagging of its tail, hence its name. It seems to be a social bird, often in a group (or family?) of about 5 or 6, hunting for insects at dusk. The Wagtails give a brave impression; I have noted nothing nervous about their behavior, although they’re not curious either of those observing them. The cats I have known over the years have never been able to catch one. My dogs and the Wagtails seem to mutually ignore each other. And my children scare them off, but only temporarily. Just the other day, I watched a Wagtail chase a butterfly that looked almost its own size. Are they very brave, fierce hunters? Or are these just my unknowledgeable observations? You see, I am not well acquainted with Wagtails or birds for that matter. But I really like them. And the purpose of this blog is to dive deep into a bird that I do not find as exciting and mysterious as an owl or as beautiful as a Lilac-breasted Roller, but it captivates me because it is always around wherever I go, and now I wish to understand it better."

    "text": "Before i begin introducing the definition and description of Wagtails i realize i personally need a beginners guide to bird terminology and classification.\n\nGenus = Class or group, Passerine birds = having feet that are adapted to perching, includes all songbirds.\nSo, Wagtails are passerine birds. They belong to the genus “Motacilla” (a latin name introduced by Swedish Naturalist Carl Von Linnaeus in 1758). The Motacillas are part of the family Motacillidae, which include Wagtails, Pipits and Longclaws. Within the Motacilla genus (Wagtails) there are 13 different species which are found all over the world. Now it starts to get confusing, (at least for me) because there are other types of wagtails that do not belong to the same genus. For example, the Willie Wagtail from Australia does not have the same genus, it belongs to group called Fantails.\nSee link to birdsoftheworld.org for images of Wagtails and other Motacillidaes.\nSide note Cornell Lab has an excellent (free) app for learning about and identifying the birds you see."
